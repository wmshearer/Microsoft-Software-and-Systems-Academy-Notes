MICROSOFT ENTRA — IDENTITY PROTECTION & GOVERNANCE (NOTES)
====================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------
MICROSOFT ENTRA ID GOVERNANCE (WHAT IT SOLVES)
------------------------------------------------------------
Goal: Balance security + productivity by ensuring
- Right users
- Right access
- Right resources
- Right time

Core questions governance answers:
- Who has access to what?
- What are they doing with it?
- Are controls effective?
- Can auditors verify compliance?

------------------------------------------------------------
IDENTITY LIFECYCLE GOVERNANCE (JOIN / MOVE / LEAVE)
------------------------------------------------------------
Identity lifecycle = managing user identities over time

Join:
- Identity created (often HR-driven)
- Access provisioned automatically
- Goal: productive on Day 1

Move:
- Role or department changes
- Access added/removed dynamically

Leave:
- Access revoked
- Identity disabled or removed (retained for audit)

Automation tools:
- HR inbound provisioning (Workday, SuccessFactors)
- Lifecycle workflows (pre-hire, role change, offboarding)
- Automatic entitlement assignment
- App provisioning to SaaS/on-prem apps

------------------------------------------------------------
ACCESS LIFECYCLE GOVERNANCE
------------------------------------------------------------
Access changes as responsibilities change

Key capabilities:
- Dynamic groups (attribute-based access)
- Entitlement Management (access packages)
- Access Reviews (recertification)

Dynamic groups:
- Membership based on user/device attributes
- Automatically updated when attributes change

Entitlement management:
- Users request access via access packages
- Approval workflows
- Automatic expiration
- Supports external (B2B) users

------------------------------------------------------------
PRIVILEGED ACCESS LIFECYCLE
------------------------------------------------------------
High-risk access requires extra governance

Privileged Identity Management (PIM):
- Just-In-Time (JIT) admin access
- Time-bound role activation
- Approval + justification required
- MFA enforced
- Full auditing

PIM workflow:
1. Assign (eligible vs active)
2. Activate (time + reason)
3. Approve / deny
4. Extend or renew
5. Audit activity

------------------------------------------------------------
ACCESS REVIEWS
------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose: Remove excess access

Used for:
- Admin roles
- Sensitive apps
- Guest users
- Compliance exceptions

Key features:
- One-time or recurring reviews
- Self-review or manager review
- Auto-apply or manual changes
- Multi-stage reviews (up to 3 levels)

------------------------------------------------------------
ENTITLEMENT MANAGEMENT
------------------------------------------------------------
Solves:
- Users don’t know what access to request
- Access persists longer than needed
- External user access complexity

Access packages include:
- Groups
- App roles
- SharePoint permissions

Benefits:
- Delegated access management
- Automated guest lifecycle
- Time-bound access

------------------------------------------------------------
TERMS OF USE
------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose: Legal & compliance acknowledgment

Key points:
- Displayed before app access
- Enforced via Conditional Access
- Can be recurring
- Track who accepted/declined

------------------------------------------------------------
MICROSOFT ENTRA ID PROTECTION
------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose: Detect & remediate identity risk

Risk types:
- Sign-in risk (suspicious authentication)
- User risk (account compromise likelihood)

Examples:
- Anonymous IP
- Atypical travel
- Leaked credentials

Actions:
- Require MFA
- Force password reset
- Block access
- Manual or automated remediation

Reports:
- Risk detections
- Risky sign-ins
- Risky users

------------------------------------------------------------
MICROSOFT ENTRA VERIFIED ID
------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose: Verifiable digital credentials (privacy-first)

Roles:
- Issuer (creates credential)
- User (stores in wallet)
- Verifier (validates claims)

Benefits:
- Cryptographically secure
- User-controlled identity
- Reduced oversharing
- Revocable / expirable credentials

------------------------------------------------------------
SECURITY COPILOT INTEGRATION
------------------------------------------------------------
Copilot + Entra enables:
- Natural language risk summaries
- Faster remediation guidance
- Workflow automation suggestions
- Embedded insights in admin portal

------------------------------------------------------------
KEY TAKEAWAYS
------------------------------------------------------------
- Governance = identity + access + privilege lifecycle
- Automation reduces risk and admin overhead
- PIM protects high-value roles
- Access reviews enforce least privilege
- ID Protection enables risk-based security
- Verified ID supports privacy-first trust
