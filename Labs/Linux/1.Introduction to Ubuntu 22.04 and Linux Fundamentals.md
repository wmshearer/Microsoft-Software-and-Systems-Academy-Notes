Ubuntu Linux System Administration Fundamentals
Lab: Ubuntu Linux Fundamentals

Overview
This lab introduces foundational Ubuntu 22.04 system administration skills. You will work entirely from the command line to explore the filesystem, navigate directories, manage files, and understand users and permissions.

------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 1: Exploring the Linux File System Hierarchy

Objective
- [ ] Understand the Linux filesystem structure
- [ ] Identify key system directories

Steps

List the root-level directories:
`sudo ls /`

This displays directories such as /etc, /usr, /home, /var, and others.

Navigate into system directories and inspect contents:

Change to /etc (system configuration files):
`cd /etc`
`sudo ls -l`

Change to /usr (user binaries and libraries):
`cd /usr`
`sudo ls -l`

Change to /home (user home directories):
`cd /home`
`sudo ls -l`

Change to /var (logs, cache, spool files):
`cd /var`
`sudo ls -l`

Visualize the directory tree

Update the package list:
`sudo apt update`

Install the tree utility:
`sudo apt install tree`

Display the first level of the root directory tree:
`sudo tree -L 1 /`

Read command documentation:
`man tree`

------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 2: Command-Line Navigation

Objective
- [ ] Navigate the filesystem efficiently
- [ ] Understand directory context

Steps

Print the current working directory:
`pwd`

Change directories:
`cd /etc`
`cd ..`
`cd ~`

Explanation:
/etc   = system configuration files  
..     = move up one directory  
~      = your home directory  

List directory contents:
`sudo ls`
`sudo ls -l`
`sudo ls -a`

Options:
-l = long (detailed) listing  
-a = include hidden files  

Clear the terminal screen:
`clear`

View command history:
`history`

Read manuals:
`man ls`
`man cd`
`man pwd`

------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 3: File and Directory Management

Objective
- [ ] Create, edit, move, and delete files and directories

Steps

Create an empty file:
`sudo touch testfile.txt`

Install the nano text editor:
`sudo apt install nano`

Edit the file:
`sudo nano testfile.txt`

Inside nano, enter text such as:
This is a sample file created using nano.

Save and exit nano:
CTRL + O → Enter  
CTRL + X  

View file contents:
`cat testfile.txt`

Create directories:
`sudo mkdir myfolder`
`sudo mkdir -p parent/child/grandchild`

Copy and move files:
`sudo cp testfile.txt myfolder/`
`sudo mv testfile.txt renamed.txt`

Delete files and directories:
`sudo rm renamed.txt`
`sudo rm -r myfolder`

Find files:
`sudo find /etc -name "hosts"`
`sudo find ~ -type f -size +1M`

Read documentation:
`man cp`
`man find`

------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 4: Users, Groups, and Permissions Overview

Objective
- [ ] Understand Linux permissions and ownership

Steps

Identify the current user and group membership:
`whoami`
`groups`
`id`

Create a file and inspect permissions:
`sudo touch perms.txt`
`sudo ls -l perms.txt`

Expected output example:
-rw-r--r--

Explanation:
- First dash: regular file  
- rw- : owner can read/write  
- r-- : group can read  
- r-- : others can read  

Change permissions using numeric mode:
`sudo chmod 644 perms.txt`

Meaning:
Owner = read/write  
Group = read  
Others = read  

Set execute permissions:
`sudo chmod 755 perms.txt`

Add execute permission:
`sudo chmod +x perms.txt`

Change ownership:
`sudo chown root:root perms.txt`

Read manuals:
`man chmod`
`man chown`
`man id`

------------------------------------------------------------

Lab Summary

In this lab, you:
- Explored the Linux filesystem hierarchy
- Navigated directories using CLI tools
- Created, edited, and managed files and folders
- Learned how permissions and ownership work in Linux

These skills are foundational for Linux system administration, scripting, automation, and server management.
