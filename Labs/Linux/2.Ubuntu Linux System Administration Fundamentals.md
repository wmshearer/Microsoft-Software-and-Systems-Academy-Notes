### Ubuntu Linux System Administration Fundamentals
### Lab: User and Group Management on Ubuntu Linux

------------------------------------------------------------
### Exercise 1: Understanding System User Files
------------------------------------------------------------

Objective:
Explore key files that store user and group information.

Ubuntu stores user account and group data in plain-text configuration files:
- `/etc/passwd` : user account information
- `/etc/shadow` : encrypted password information (root only)
- `/etc/group`  : group definitions

Steps:

- [ ] View the list of user accounts:
  `sudo cat /etc/passwd`

  This file contains usernames, user IDs (UIDs), group IDs (GIDs), home directories, and default shells.

- [ ] View password hashes (restricted to root):
  `sudo cat /etc/shadow`

  This file stores encrypted passwords and password aging information. Only root can read it.

- [ ] View group definitions:
  `sudo cat /etc/group`

  This file lists all groups on the system and their associated members.

- [ ] Find information about the currently logged-in user:
  `grep $(whoami) /etc/passwd`

  `grep` searches for text patterns.  
  `$(whoami)` expands to your current username and searches for it in `/etc/passwd`.

- [ ] Review associated manual pages:
  `man passwd`
  `man shadow`
  `man group`

------------------------------------------------------------
### Exercise 2: Creating, Modifying, and Deleting Users and Groups
------------------------------------------------------------

Objective:
Create user and group accounts, modify them, and delete them.

Steps:

- [ ] Create a new user:
  `sudo adduser testuser`

  Follow the prompts to set the password and optional user information.

- [ ] Create a new group:
  `sudo addgroup testgroup`

- [ ] Add the user to the group:
  `sudo usermod -aG testgroup testuser`

  Explanation:
  - `-a` appends the user to an existing group
  - `-G` specifies the group name

- [ ] Verify group membership:
  `groups testuser`

- [ ] Change the user’s default login shell:
  `sudo usermod -s /bin/bash testuser`

  This sets Bash as the default shell for the user.

- [ ] Rename the user account:
  `sudo usermod -l newtestuser testuser`

  The `-l` flag specifies a new login name.

- [ ] Delete the user:
  `sudo deluser newtestuser`

- [ ] Delete the group:
  `sudo delgroup testgroup`

- [ ] Explore related manual pages:
  `man adduser`
  `man usermod`
  `man deluser`

------------------------------------------------------------
### Results
------------------------------------------------------------

After completing this lab, you should be able to:
- Identify where Linux stores user and group data
- Safely view system account files
- Create, modify, and delete users and groups
- Understand how group membership and login shells work

These skills are foundational for Linux system administration, security management, and automation.
