# AI-900 — Condensed Exam-Day Notes (No Fluff)

## Generative AI — Key Points

- Generates **new content**: text, images, video, code, audio.
- Powered by **language models** trained on massive datasets.
- Models understand **semantic relationships** → they predict meaningful next words.
- **LLMs** = large, general, powerful, but costly.  
- **SLMs** = smaller, cheaper, better for narrow domains.

### Generative AI Scenarios
- Chatbots / AI agents  
- Content creation (documents, code, drafts)  
- Translation  
- Summarization / explanation  


## Computer Vision — Key Points

- Trained on **large sets of labeled images**.
- **Image classification** → identify the subject of an image.  
- **Object detection** → locate objects in an image.  
- **Semantic segmentation** → pixel-level object mapping.  
- **Multimodal models** combine vision + language.

### Computer Vision Scenarios
- Auto-tagging photos  
- Visual search  
- Retail checkout automation  
- Security monitoring  
- Facial recognition  
- Robotics / self-driving systems  


## Speech — Key Points

- **Speech recognition** = speech → text  
- **Speech synthesis** = text → spoken audio  
- Modern speech AI handles noise, interruptions, and expressive tone.

### Speech Scenarios
- Voice assistants  
- Meeting/call transcription  
- Audio descriptions  
- Speech translation  


## Natural Language Processing (NLP) — Key Points

- Traditional NLP = models for **specific text analysis tasks**.  
- Often cheaper than generative AI for simple workloads.

### Common NLP Tasks
- **Entity extraction** (people, places, organizations)  
- **Text classification**  
- **Sentiment analysis**  
- **Language detection**

### NLP Scenarios
- Analyze documents or transcripts  
- Analyze posts/reviews for sentiment  
- FAQ chatbots / rule-based conversational flows  


## Data & Insight Extraction — Key Points

- Built on **OCR** to read text from images/documents.
- Advanced models extract **specific fields**, not just characters.
- Newer models can extract from **audio, images, and video**.

### Data Extraction Scenarios
- Automating form processing  
- Digitizing large archives  
- Document indexing  
- Extracting key points from meetings/recordings  


## Responsible AI — Key Points

- **Fairness** → avoid biased outputs  
- **Reliability & safety** → models are probabilistic; build safeguards  
- **Privacy & security** → protect data & trained models  
- **Inclusiveness** → avoid excluding users  
- **Transparency** → explain how AI works / its limits  
- **Accountability** → humans/organizations are responsible

### Responsible AI Example Scenarios
- College admissions → test for fairness  
- Robot vision → act only with high confidence  
- Facial ID → delete images when no longer needed  
- Speech chatbot → provide captions for accessibility  
- Loan approval → disclose AI use & training data characteristics
