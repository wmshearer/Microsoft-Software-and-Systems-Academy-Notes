# What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to software capabilities that enable applications to exhibit human-like behavior. Modern AI solutions are built on machine learning models trained on large datasets that capture semantic and statistical relationships, allowing applications to interpret input, reason over data, and generate predictions or responses across multiple input formats.

## Common AI Capabilities

### Generative AI
Generative AI enables applications to generate original responses to natural language prompts. It is commonly used for conversational apps, content creation, research assistance, and task automation.

### Agents
Agents are generative AI applications that can respond to user input or autonomously assess situations and take actions, such as retrieving information, automating tasks, or coordinating workflows.

### Computer Vision
Computer vision enables applications to accept, interpret, and process visual input from images, video, and live camera streams, supporting scenarios such as object detection, image analysis, and automated visual inspection.

### Speech
Speech capabilities allow applications to recognize spoken language (speech-to-text) and generate spoken output (text-to-speech), enabling conversational and voice-driven user interactions.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural language processing enables applications to analyze written or spoken language, identify key points, categorize content, and generate summaries or responses.

### Information Extraction
Information extraction combines vision, speech, and NLP to extract structured data from unstructured sources such as documents, forms, images, audio recordings, and video.

### Decision Support
Decision support systems use historical data and learned correlations to make predictions that assist business decision-making, such as forecasting trends or evaluating risk.

## Generative AI Overview

Generative AI uses language models to respond to natural language prompts, enabling conversational applications, agents, and creative tools. These models may be large language models (LLMs) trained on massive datasets with many parameters, or small language models (SLMs) optimized for specific scenarios with lower computational overhead.

Modern generative AI models are increasingly multimodal, meaning they can accept text, image, or speech prompts and generate outputs such as text, code, images, or audio.

# Foundry Tools

Foundry Tools are prebuilt Azure AI services that developers can integrate into applications to add AI capabilities without building or training models from scratch.

## Common Foundry Tools

### Azure OpenAI
Provides access to OpenAI generative models, including the GPT family and DALL-E image generation models, hosted securely within Azure.

### Azure Vision
Provides computer vision capabilities such as image analysis, object detection, caption generation, tagging, and optical character recognition (OCR).

### Azure Speech
Provides speech-to-text, text-to-speech, speaker recognition, and translation capabilities.

### Azure Language
Provides NLP capabilities including entity extraction, sentiment analysis, summarization, conversational language models, and question answering.

### Microsoft Foundry Content Safety
Provides algorithms to analyze text and images and flag content that may be offensive, risky, or undesirable.

### Azure Translator
Provides text translation between a large number of languages.

### Azure AI Face
Provides specialized computer vision capabilities to detect, analyze, and recognize human faces, with restricted access to sensitive features.

### Azure AI Custom Vision
Enables training and use of custom image classification and object detection models.

### Azure Document Intelligence
Provides prebuilt and custom models to extract structured fields from documents such as invoices, receipts, and forms.

### Azure Content Understanding
Provides multimodal analysis to extract information from documents, images, video, and audio.

### Azure AI Search
Uses AI skill pipelines to extract content and create searchable and vector indexes, commonly used to ground generative AI prompts.

## Foundry Tools Resource Options

Foundry Tools can be provisioned as standalone Azure AI resources with individual endpoints and keys, or as a combined Foundry Tools resource that exposes multiple services through a single endpoint, simplifying management for applications that use multiple AI capabilities.

# Microsoft Foundry

Microsoft Foundry is a platform for AI development on Azure and is recommended for building all but the most simple AI solutions. It centralizes AI resource management, access control, cost management, and development workflows.

## Microsoft Foundry Capabilities
Microsoft Foundry provides a web-based portal for managing AI projects and an SDK for programmatic access to models, agents, and connected resources.

## Microsoft Foundry Projects

### Foundry Projects
Foundry projects are associated with a Microsoft Foundry resource and support generative AI models, agent development, Foundry Tools integration, evaluation, and responsible AI practices. They are optimized for building generative AI chat applications and agents with minimal administrative overhead.

### Hub-Based Projects
Hub-based projects are associated with an Azure AI hub resource and include a Microsoft Foundry resource, managed compute, Prompt Flow support, connected storage, and Azure Key Vault. These projects support advanced scenarios such as Prompt Flow development, model fine-tuning, and collaboration between developers and data scientists.

# Developer Tools and SDKs

AI solutions can be developed using common development environments such as Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.

## Microsoft Foundry for Visual Studio Code
The Microsoft Foundry VS Code extension simplifies project creation, model selection and deployment, testing models in playgrounds, and creating agents.

## SDKs and APIs
Developers can use the Microsoft Foundry SDK to connect to Foundry projects, the Foundry Models API to work with generative model endpoints, the Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models API for chat applications, Foundry Tools SDKs and REST APIs for AI services, and the Microsoft Foundry Agent Service, which integrates with frameworks such as Semantic Kernel.

GitHub integration and GitHub Copilot support source control, collaboration, and AI-assisted development.

# Responsible AI

Responsible AI is critical because AI systems rely on probabilistic models and can cause harm if misused or poorly designed.

## Fairness
AI systems should treat all people fairly and avoid bias, ensuring training data is representative and performance is evaluated across user populations.

## Reliability and Safety
AI systems must perform reliably and safely, particularly in high-risk scenarios, and should apply appropriate confidence thresholds and rigorous testing.

## Privacy and Security
AI systems must protect personal data during training, inference, storage, and access through appropriate safeguards.

## Inclusiveness
AI systems should empower and engage people of all abilities and backgrounds through inclusive design and testing.

## Transparency
AI systems should be understandable, with users informed about purpose, limitations, confidence scores, and data usage.

## Accountability
Developers and organizations remain responsible for AI behavior, governance, and compliance with legal and ethical standards.

# Module Assessement
