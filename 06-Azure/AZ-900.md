### AZ-900T00 Learning Path 01: Cloud concepts
 
#### Cloud Computing
- What is cloud computing?
    - NIST Definition: The delivery of computing services over the internet, enabling faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale
    - Services include:
        - Compute
        - Networking
        - Storage
- Cloud models
    1. Private cloud: Cloud Environment dedicated to one organization/tenant
    2. Public Cloud: Cloud Environment with multiple tenants using that cloud infrastructure
    3. Hybrid Cloud: Combination of public and private cloud
        - done for number of reasons
        - Common for transition from on-prem to solely cloud
- Compare CapEx vs OpEx
    - Capital Expenditure (CapEx): The upfront spending of money on physical infrastructure
        - Costs from CapEx have a value that reduces over time
    - Operational Expenditure (OpEx): Spend on prducts and services as needed, pay-as-you-go
        - Costs can go up over time
- Consumption based model: Pay only for resources that you use.
    - Better cost prediction
    - Prices for individual resources and services are provided
    - Billing is based on actual usage
 
 
 
#### Cloud Benefits
- HA and Scalability
- Terms for cloud (HA, Elasticity, Scalability, Reliability, Predictability, Security, Governance, Manageability)
    - HA and Reliablity: HA is expressed in SLAs most commonly
    - Scalability and Elasticity:
        - Scalablity is increase of capacity, vertical or horizontal.
        - Elasticity is real-time scaling via automation for changes in demand.
    - Predictability: Predictability of features and performance of a service. Predictability of costs based on usage.
    - Security, Governance, and Manageability:
        - Governance: The rules and policies in place that dictate what is allowed and not allowed in support of operations.
        - Security: You know what this is about intuitively
        - Manageability: Relying on technologies built into the public cloud model to perform upkeep and such.
 
 
#### Cloud Service Types
- IaaS: Infrastructure
    - PAYGo for IT infrastructure. You rent servers so you can make virtual infrastructure. Build your own environment.
    - Example of IaaS: Virtual Machine
- PaaS: Platform
    - Everything in between. Hard to define. You lose some control over infrax but still for building your own solutions.
    - Example of PaaS: Operating Systems, Databases
- SaaS: Software
    - PAYGo for a software service provided via cloud.
    - Example: Office 365
- Shared responsiblity Model: The level of responsiblity differs between the 3 models

### Learning Path 02: Azure Architecture and Services
 
#### Azure archtiectural components
- Azure accounts: Represents a commercial arrangement between Microsoft and a Customer
    - Azure Account
    - Azure Free Account
    - Azure Free Student Account
    - Microsoft Learn Sandbox
- Regions and AZ
    - Regions: Regions are made up of one or more data ceneters in close proximity. Aids in latency and Data Residency requirements. They often come in pairs.
    - Availability Zones (AZ): Create multiple physical data ceneters within the same region to aid in HA.
        - Up-to 3 zones per region
        - Not every region has AZs.
    - Region Pairs: Tying pairs of regions together to provide more resiliency
        - Microsoft decides region pairs
        - Ex) Storage can be geo-redundant incase something happens to one region.
    - Azure Sovereign regions (US Gov services): Meets the security and compliance needs of US federal agencies, state and local governments, and their solution providers.
        - Azure Government: Separate instance of Azure for the US Government. Physically isolated from non-US gov deployments. Accessible only to screened, authorized personnel
        - Azure China
        - Azure Germany
        - Azure France
        - etc
- Subscriptions and Resource groups
    - Azure Resources: Components like storage, VMs, networks, app services, SQL databases, Functions, and more that are available to build cloud solutions
    - Resource Groups: A container you use to manage and aggregate resources in a single unit
        - Lets you basically group your resources by what goes together
        - Resources can only belong to one resource group
        - Resources in a resource group can span regions
        - We can also link different resource groups together for our applications
        - Deleting a resource group deletes can delete all resources as well. Easy clean up.
    - Azure subscriptions: within an account you make subscriptions that function as 2 boundaries. Paying gets you access controls to the resources.
        - Billing boundary: generate separate billing reports and invoices for each subscription
        - Access control boundary: Manage and control access to the resources that users can provision with specific subscriptions
    - Management groups: Lets you manage multiple subscriptions together as a single entity via a hierarchy
        - Can be up to 6 levels of depth if the organization needs that. Not generally done though, 2-3 tops.

#### Compute and Networking
- Compute types (Containers, VMs, Functions)
    - Azure compute is an on-demand service that provides computing resources (disk, processors, memory, networking, etc)
    - Azure VMs: Software emulations of phsyical computers (vCPU, memory, storage, and networking). IaaS means full control of OS.  
    - App Services: Deploying web apps and API apps
    - Container instances: Azure containers provide that lightweight virutalzied env for a service
        - ACI: Azure Container instances, a PaaS offerening that runs a container or pod of containers in azure
        - ACA: Azure Container Apps, a PaaS offering, like ACI, that can load balance and scale
        - AKS: An orchestration service for containers with distributed architectures and large volumes of containers
    - Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS): Container orchestration
    - Azure Virtual Desktop: Creating a VDI environment
    - Azure Functions: PaaS offerening that allows you to write code that responds to a particular trigger.
- VM Options
    - VM Scale Sets: A way to implement automatic horizontal scaling when needed. A collection of VMs configured exactly the same that turn on when theyre needed and off when not needed. These implement availability sets by default.
    - VM Availability Sets: Control the placement of VMs to a given data center.
- Resources required for VMs
- Application hosting options
- Describe Virtual Networking
- Public and Private endpoints
