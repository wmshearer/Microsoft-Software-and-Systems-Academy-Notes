# Modified → Staged → Committed (GUI edition)

## The big idea
- ✏️ **Modified**: you edited and saved a file in VS Code.
- ➕ **Staged**: you told Git “include this in the next snapshot.” (Click the **+** in Source Control.)
- ✅ **Committed**: you saved the snapshot to history with a message. (Click the **✔** checkmark.)

## Where to see this in VS Code
- [ ] Click **Source Control (🌿)** on the left
- [ ] You’ll see files under **Changes** (modified)
- [ ] Click the **+** next to a file to move it to **Staged Changes**
- [ ] Type a short message at the top (e.g., “Add README”)
- [ ] Click **✔ Commit**

> Tip: If you don’t see **Source Control**, press **Ctrl+B** to toggle the sidebar.
