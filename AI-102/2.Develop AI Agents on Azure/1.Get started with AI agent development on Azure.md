# AI agents and agent development in Microsoft Foundry

## What are AI agents
AI agents are intelligent applications that use language models to understand user intent and take actions on a user’s behalf. Unlike traditional chatbots, agents can remember conversation context, make decisions, and perform tasks such as invoking functions or interacting with external systems.

An AI agent is composed of:
- A language model for reasoning and natural language generation
- Instructions that guide agent behavior
- Tools that allow the agent to take actions

## Core agent capabilities (expense agent example)

### Knowledge integration and reasoning
Agents use a generative model grounded with domain-specific data (for example, corporate policy documentation) to answer questions accurately.

### Task automation through functions
Agents execute programmatic functions to complete tasks automatically, such as submitting expense claims.

### Intelligent decision-making
Agents apply business logic to route or approve actions, such as sending expense claims to the correct approver based on amount and policy.

## Multi-agent coordination (travel agent example)
AI agents can work together to complete complex workflows.

Key multi-agent capabilities include:
- Service integration: calling external APIs (for example, flight and hotel booking)
- Cross-agent communication: one agent invoking another agent (travel agent triggering expense agent)
- End-to-end automation: completing multi-step workflows without manual intervention

## Security risks of AI agents
Because agents can access sensitive data and act autonomously, they introduce new security risks beyond traditional applications.

Key risk areas include:
- Data leakage and privacy exposure
- Prompt injection and manipulation attacks
- Unauthorized access and privilege escalation
- Data poisoning
- Supply chain vulnerabilities from third-party plugins
- Over-reliance on autonomous actions
- Inadequate auditability and logging
- Model inversion and output leakage

## Security best practices for agents
A security-by-design approach includes:
- Enforcing role-based access control (RBAC) and least privilege
- Validating and filtering all inputs to prevent prompt injection
- Adding human-in-the-loop approvals for sensitive actions
- Maintaining comprehensive logging and traceability
- Auditing third-party dependencies
- Continuously retraining and validating models to detect drift or poisoning

# Options for agent development

## Traditional AI frameworks vs agent frameworks
Traditional AI frameworks enhance applications with intelligence such as personalization, automation, and improved user experience. AI agent frameworks extend these capabilities by enabling autonomous, goal-oriented systems that reason, act, and collaborate.

Key agent framework capabilities:
- Agent collaboration and coordination
- Multi-step task automation and delegation
- Contextual understanding and adaptation

## Microsoft agent development options

### Microsoft Foundry Agent Service
A managed Azure service for creating, managing, and using AI agents within Microsoft Foundry. It is based on the OpenAI Assistants API but offers broader model choice, enterprise security, and deeper Azure integration. Supports both visual development and code-first development using the Microsoft Foundry SDK.

### OpenAI Assistants API
Provides a subset of agent functionality and can only be used with OpenAI models. In Azure, it can be accessed through Azure OpenAI, but offers less flexibility than Foundry Agent Service.

### Microsoft Agent Framework
A lightweight development kit optimized for building single-agent or multi-agent systems and orchestrating agentic patterns.

### AutoGen
An open-source framework useful for rapid experimentation, research, and ideation with agents.

### Microsoft 365 Agents SDK
Enables professional developers to build self-hosted agents that can be delivered through Microsoft 365 and other channels such as Slack or Messenger.

### Microsoft Copilot Studio
A low-code environment for business users to build agents that integrate with Microsoft 365 and common communication platforms.

### Copilot Studio lite experience
A declarative, no-code experience inside Microsoft 365 Copilot that allows business users to author simple agents by describing required functionality.

## Choosing an agent development solution
Selection depends on user skill level and scenario:
- Business users (no code): Copilot Studio lite
- Low-code business users: Copilot Studio
- Developers extending Microsoft 365 Copilot: Microsoft 365 Agents SDK
- Azure-based agentic solutions: Foundry Agent Service
- Standalone or multi-agent systems: Microsoft Agent Framework

# Microsoft Foundry Agent Service details

## What it provides
Foundry Agent Service enables creation, testing, and management of AI agents using:
- A visual agent playground in the Microsoft Foundry portal
- A code-first approach via the Microsoft Foundry SDK

## Components of a Foundry agent
Agents include:
- Model: a deployed generative AI model used for reasoning and response generation
- Knowledge: data sources used to ground prompts (for example, Bing search, Azure AI Search index, or custom documents)
- Tools: programmatic functions that allow automation (built-in tools, code interpreter for Python, or custom tools)
Agent conversations occur in threads that retain message history and generated artifacts.
