# A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol — Key Notes + Assessment Answers

## What A2A is
A2A is a **standard protocol** for agent discovery + communication + coordinated execution across **remote/distributed agents**. It makes it easier to:
- discover what another agent can do
- delegate work to the right agent
- exchange context + results securely (auth is part of the protocol)

---

## Two key “discovery” concepts

### Agent Skills
A **skill** = one capability the agent exposes.
Typical fields:
- `id`, `name`, `description`
- `tags`, `examples`
- supported `input_modes` / `output_modes` (ex: text, JSON)

### Agent Card
A **machine-readable “business card”** for the agent (what it can do + how to call it).
Typical fields:
- identity: name/description/version
- endpoint URL (where the A2A service lives)
- capabilities (ex: streaming)
- default input/output modes
- list of skills
- auth support

Usually served at something like `/.well-known/agent-card.json`.

## Agent Executor (the “doer”)
The Agent Executor is the component that **actually handles incoming A2A requests**.

Responsibilities:
- `execute`: process a request (prompt + context) and emit results/events
- `cancel`: cancel an in-progress task (optional)
It uses:
- `RequestContext` to understand the request
- an `EventQueue` to send back messages, updates, artifacts, etc.

## Hosting an A2A agent (server side)
A hosted agent has 3 main parts:

1) **Agent Card**
2) **Request Handler**
   - routes requests to the executor (`execute` / `cancel`)
   - manages task lifecycle via a **Task Store**
3) **Server App**
   - web framework (ex: Starlette in Python) + ASGI server (ex: Uvicorn)

Run command example: `uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`

---

## Connecting to an A2A agent (client side)
Client flow:
1) Know the server base URL
2) Fetch the Agent Card (discovery)
3) Send a request:
   - non-streaming: wait for full response
   - streaming: receive incremental updates
4) Handle responses:
   - direct message(s)
   - or task-based results (track status / cancel if supported)

# Module assessment answers

## 1) What is the primary role of an A2A server?
✅ **It routes requests between clients and connected agents.**

## 2) What does the Agent Executor do in an A2A agent?
✅ **Processes incoming requests and generates responses or events.**

## 3) What is an agent card used for in A2A?
✅ **It provides metadata about the agent, such as its capabilities and available functions.**
