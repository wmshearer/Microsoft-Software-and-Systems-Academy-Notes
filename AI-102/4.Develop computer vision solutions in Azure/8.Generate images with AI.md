# Image Generation with Generative AI

## Overview
- Generative AI can create **original images** from natural language prompts
- Image generation is supported in **Microsoft Foundry**
- Common use cases:
  - Illustrations and marketing assets
  - Product and brand visuals
  - Concept art and design mockups
- Images are **generated**, not retrieved from a database or search index

## What Are Image-Generation Models?
- Image-generation models convert **text descriptions → images**
- Output is **new, original graphical content**
- Models learn visual concepts during training and synthesize images at runtime

### Key Characteristics
- Prompt-driven
- No image lookup or retrieval
- Supports creative and photorealistic outputs
- Deterministic controls via parameters (size, style, quality)

## Image-Generation Models in Microsoft Foundry
Microsoft Foundry supports multiple image-generation models, including:

- DALL-E 3
- GPT-Image 1

### Model Notes
- DALL-E 3:
  - Supports only `n = 1` image per request
  - Generates images synchronously
  - Returns a URL to the generated image

## Exploring Image Generation in Foundry Portal
- Use the **Images playground** in Microsoft Foundry portal
- Purpose:
  - Test prompts
  - Preview generated images
  - Experiment with settings

### Adjustable Settings
- Image size:
  - 1024x1024 (default)
  - 1792x1024
  - 1024x1792
- Style:
  - vivid (default)
  - natural
- Quality:
  - standard (default)
  - hd

## Creating an Image Generation Client Application
You can generate images using:
- REST API
- Language-specific SDKs (Python, .NET)

### Required Request Components
- Authorization key in header
- JSON body defining generation parameters

## Image Generation Request Parameters
Common parameters include:

- prompt
  - Natural language description of desired image
- n
  - Number of images to generate
  - DALL-E 3 supports only `n = 1`
- size
  - Resolution of generated image
- quality (optional)
  - standard or hd
- style (optional)
  - vivid or natural

## Image Generation Workflow
1. Deploy an image-generation model
2. Submit a text prompt
3. Specify image parameters (size, style, quality)
4. Receive synchronous response
5. Use returned image URL

## Image Generation Response
- Response includes:
  - URL to generated PNG image
  - Revised prompt used by the system

### Revised Prompt
- The model may refine the original prompt
- Used internally to improve output quality
- Returned for transparency and debugging

## Key Exam Concepts
- Image generation uses **specialized image-generation models**
- DALL-E is for **image generation**, not chat
- Images playground is used for testing
- `n` controls number of images generated
- Output is **original**, not retrieved

## Module Assessment – Answers
1. Which model should you use to generate images?
   - DALL-E

2. Which playground should you use?
   - Images

3. What does the `n` parameter indicate?
   - The number of images to be generated
