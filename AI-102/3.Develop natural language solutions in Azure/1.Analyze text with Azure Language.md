# Azure Language — Text Analytics (Condensed Notes)

## What Azure Language does
Azure Language extracts **insight from text** using pretrained NLP models. Common use cases:
- Language detection
- Key phrase extraction
- Sentiment analysis
- Named entity recognition (NER)
- Entity linking (disambiguation with references)

You must **provision an Azure Language resource** (via Microsoft Foundry portal or Azure) and use:
- an **endpoint**
- an **API key**
APIs can be called via **REST (JSON)** or **SDKs**.

---

## Language Detection
Determines the **primary language** of text and returns a **confidence score (0–1)**.

Key limits:
- Max **5,120 characters per document**
- Up to **1,000 documents per request**

Important behaviors:
- Mixed-language text → returns the **dominant language**, lower confidence
- Unreadable/ambiguous text → `(Unknown)` with confidence `0.0`

Typical request type: `LanguageDetection`  
Typical response fields:
- `name`
- `iso6391Name`
- `confidenceScore`

---

## Key Phrase Extraction
Identifies **important words and phrases** that summarize main ideas.

Best for:
- Longer documents
- Search indexing
- Topic summaries

Key notes:
- Requires language to be specified
- Same size limits as other text analytics features

Returns:
- `keyPhrases[]` per document

---

## Sentiment Analysis
Evaluates **emotional tone** of text.

Returns:
- Overall document sentiment: `positive | neutral | negative | mixed`
- Per-sentence sentiment
- Confidence scores for:
  - positive
  - neutral
  - negative

Rules:
- All neutral → neutral
- Positive + neutral → positive
- Negative + neutral → negative
- Positive + negative → mixed

Common use cases:
- Customer feedback monitoring
- Review analysis
- Support prioritization

---

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Detects **entities mentioned in text** and categorizes them.

Examples:
- Person
- Location
- Organization
- DateTime
- Email, URL, Address

Each entity includes:
- `text`
- `category` (+ optional `subcategory`)
- `offset`, `length`
- `confidenceScore`

NER identifies **what type of thing** an entity is — not *which exact one*.

---

## Entity Linking
Resolves **ambiguity** by linking entities to **real-world references** (Wikipedia).

Example:
- "Venus" → planet OR mythological goddess
- "Paris" → city OR Greek character

Returns:
- Entity name
- Matched text
- Confidence
- URL (Wikipedia)
- Data source

Used when:
- Same word can represent **multiple real-world entities**
- You need **disambiguation**, not just classification

# Module Assessment — Answers

## 1) How should you create an application that monitors comments and flags negative posts?
✅ **Use the Azure Language service to perform sentiment analysis of the comments.**

## 2) How can you tell whether "Paris" refers to the city or the character in *The Iliad*?
✅ **Use the Azure Language service to extract linked entities.**
