## Using Prebuilt Models
- Available via:
  - Azure Document Intelligence Studio (GUI)
  - REST API
  - SDKs (Python, C#, Java, JavaScript)
- Requires:
  - Service endpoint
  - API key
- Calls are asynchronous:
  - Submit document
  - Poll for results

## Exam Tips
- Use **General Document model** when:
  - You need entity extraction
  - Document structure varies
- Use **Layout model** when:
  - You need checkbox state
  - You care about table structure
- Word documents are NOT supported:
  - Convert to PDF before submission
- Selection marks indicate:
  - Checked or unchecked boxes
