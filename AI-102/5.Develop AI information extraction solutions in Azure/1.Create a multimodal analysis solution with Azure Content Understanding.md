# Azure Content Understanding

## Overview
- Organizations store valuable information in:
  - Documents
  - Images
  - Audio
  - Video
- Extracting insights traditionally requires **multiple services**
- Azure Content Understanding provides a **single multimodal service**
- Designed to extract structured data and insights from **any content format**
- Currently in **public preview**

## What Is Azure Content Understanding?
- A **generative AI service** for multimodal content analysis
- Part of **Foundry Tools**
- Used to build **custom analyzers** that extract defined fields
- Supports:
  - Documents & forms
  - Images
  - Audio
  - Video

## Key Capabilities
- Unified analysis across content types
- Schema-driven extraction
- Minimal training data required
- Generative AI maps schema fields automatically
- Produces structured JSON output

## Supported Content Types
### Documents & Forms
- Extract structured fields (e.g., invoice totals, dates, IDs)
- Useful for automation and workflows

### Images
- Extract visual insights
- Detect objects, people, defects, charts, or patterns

### Audio
- Summarize recordings
- Extract sentiment
- Identify key information from calls or messages

### Video
- Summarize presentations
- Extract key events
- Analyze activities in footage

## Core Concept: Analyzers
- A **Content Understanding solution = an analyzer**
- An analyzer is trained to extract specific information
- Based on a **schema you define**

## High-Level Analyzer Workflow
1. Create a Foundry Tools resource
2. Define a schema
3. Build an analyzer
4. Use analyzer on new content
5. Receive structured JSON output

## Creating an Analyzer with Microsoft Foundry
- Preferred development method
- Uses the **Microsoft Foundry portal**
- Automatically provisions:
  - Foundry Tools
  - Storage
  - Key Vault

## Defining a Schema
- First step in analyzer creation
- Schema defines:
  - Fields to extract
  - Field types
- Created using:
  - Sample content
  - Analyzer templates
- Generative AI auto-detects mappings
- Manual labeling is optional for accuracy

## Schema Notes
- Schema templates depend on content type
- Some schemas support advanced features:
  - Barcodes
  - Formulas
- Schemas are versioned

## Testing an Analyzer
- Test during schema development
- Upload sample or new files
- Review:
  - Extracted field values
  - JSON output
- Used to refine schema before build

## Building an Analyzer
- Makes analyzer available via API
- Accessible through Foundry Tools endpoint
- Can continue refining after build
- Multiple versions supported

## Using the Content Understanding REST API
- Used to:
  - Create analyzers
  - Manage analyzers
  - Analyze content programmatically
- Requires:
  - Endpoint
  - Authorization key
- Keys available in:
  - Azure portal
  - Microsoft Foundry portal

## REST API Analysis Pattern
- Asynchronous operation
- Two-step process:
  1. Submit analysis request
  2. Poll for results using operation ID

## Analyze Content Request
- Submit content via:
  - URL
  - Binary data
- Returns:
  - Operation ID
  - Operation status

## Retrieve Analysis Results
- Poll results endpoint using operation ID
- When complete:
  - JSON output returned
- Output structure depends on schema

## Key Exam Concepts
- Azure Content Understanding is **multimodal**
- Uses **analyzers**, not models or indexes
- Requires **Foundry Tools**
- Schema defines what is extracted
- REST API is asynchronous
